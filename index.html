        <p class="para_one">Hey there! And welcome to my blog where we talk about everything and anything. Today, we will be stepping into the world of ethics. So grab your popcorn, put on your thinking caps, and get ready for an exhilarating ride. As teenagers, you're probably thinking about a lot of things right now, like school, friends, and your future. But you might also be thinking about some bigger ethical questions, like how to juggle the world of social media with your online friends, your physical friends, your parents telling you not to spend too much time on your phone, how to navigate the choppy waters of family relationships, trying to make sense of complex sexual ethics, and striving to respect the dignity, life, and freedom of others. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions, choices, and growth, but fear not, because together we'll analyze two thought-provoking documentaries, 'What is a Woman', and 'Childhood 2.0' to gain a deeper understanding of these issues and foster meaningful discussions on the process of ethical decision-making. </p>
        <p class="para_two">We'll dive into the intriguing documentary, ‘What is a Woman’, where we'll journey through the intricate world of gender identity. As we explore these issues, we'll unravel the notions of respect, dignity, and freedom that form the foundation of our society. Next, ‘Childhood 2.0’ takes us on an exhilarating exploration of the digital environment that shapes our lives. From being social media obsessed to online gaming addictions to the blurred boundaries of the digital age, we'll delve into the positives and negatives of our virtual existence. Prepare yourself for shocking facts about the impact of technology on our relationships, self-image, and mental health. Get ready to question the boundaries of family dynamics in the digital age and ponder the ethics of parental control versus personal freedom.</p>

        <h3>The Ethics of Family Relationships:</h3>
        <p class="para_three">Family plays a crucial role in shaping our lives and moral compass. “Well-functioning families are truly the first and irreplaceable school of social life, an example and stimulus for relationships in the broader community which are marked by respect, justice, dialogue, and love” (Elegido, 2020, p. 93). This statement goes to show how important our families our in our lives, and we tend to spend more of our time with the things and people that are important to us. So why let technology negatively impact this aspect of our lives and not foster it? </p>
        <p class="para_four">The documentary 'Childhood 2.0' emphasizes the influence of technology on family dynamics, concentrating on how relationships can be affected by the digital environment. On the one hand, technology makes it easier for us to connect and communicate. On the other hand, however, it also raises ethical issues in regard to finding a balance between online interactions and in-person connections. We can encourage genuine connections and make sure that technology complements rather than replaces real family interactions by establishing boundaries and striking a healthy balance. Prioritizing meaningful engagement, spending quality time with loved ones, family outings, game nights, or simply sharing a meal, and nurturing healthy relationships are key aspects of ethical family dynamics. Drop your phone, step outside, and spend quality time with your family. </p>
        <p class="para_five">Being able to talk to your parents if, for example, someone is bullying you online or sending you inappropriate messages and pictures can be achieved by establishing a safe, trustworthy, and understanding relationship with your parents.</p>

            <h3>Sexual Ethics:</h3>
            <p class="para_six">As teenagers going through puberty, it is normal to feel attracted to the opposite sex but knowing how to navigate these feelings and attractions is extremely important as they will have a long-lasting impact on your lives. ‘Childhood 2.0’ sheds light on the pressure on teenagers to do certain things they should not do, even when they do not feel comfortable doing them. With the advent of technology and social media, we can see how easy it is for this generation to engage in immoral acts in comparison with past generations. What with the pressure online, offline, unsolicited pop-up ads, access to multiple search engines, etc.? But what is not talked about enough is the way these things affect who you are. Access to immoral materials, people, and acts can cause trauma, make the person addicted to doing these immoral things, and also lead to one inflicting these same things on someone else, which just makes it a non-ending cycle. Now this is where ethics comes in, cultivating good habits that promote rather than hinder our positive fulfillment.  </p>
            <p class="para_seven">If you can continuously work towards developing virtues such as chastity, don’t you think the world would be a better place for you and everyone else? Respecting people’s words, wishes, privacy, and even yours is all part of being sexually ethical. Have a trusted and wiser person that you can confide in, ask questions, and talk about issues bothering you. Try as much as possible to make decisions that align with your virtuous values and beliefs, and prioritize your physical, emotional, and mental well-being above societal pressures or peer influence. It is not only teenagers that struggle with being sexually ethical, some adults also do as we saw in the documentary ‘Childhood 2.0’. This explains why some adults ask for immoral things from even underage children and do not respect themselves or the boundaries of others. And this is yet another reason why in-depth knowledge of sexual ethics is quite important to help people in dealing with these issues when they arise. Giving a male that now identifies as female access to a female washroom is not sexually ethical, and it also infringes on people’s privacy.</p>

        <h3>Respect for dignity, life, and freedom of others:</h3>
        <p class="para_eight">At its most basic, the concept of human dignity is the belief that all people hold a special value, the inherent worth that’s tied solely to their humanity. It has nothing to do with their class, race, gender, religion, abilities, or any other factor other than them being human. Freedom refers to an absence of undue restrictions and an opportunity to exercise one's rights and powers so long as it is not negatively affecting the person or someone else but is instead promoting fulfillment.</p>
        <p class="para_nine">Giving a child the choice of choosing their gender is not freedom contrary to what was said by some specialists in the documentary ‘What is a Woman?”. Some countries like Canada have made it legal for children as young as ten-and-a-half to decide with or without the consent of their parents to be on puberty blockers. Puberty blockers are a type of prescription medication that is used to stop the onset of puberty. According to the American College of Pediatricians, the public promotion of transgenderism is regarded as a type of child abuse. Whatever principle or law put in place for humans to follow is to follow the natural law but reassigning genders, identifying as an animal, a plant or any of these do not follow the natural law. </p>
        <p class="para_ten">Generally, people, but especially children of that age should not make important decisions like that as they are still quite young and highly emotional. So people should not just transition to a different gender because they feel like they do not belong in that body or they feel like they have some characteristics that are more like another gender. Humans are emotional beings, but we are also rational beings. It is only sensible to let the rational part of us have more control over our actions rather than our emotions, as our emotions are ever-changing. Freedom is supposed to help promote our fulfillment not impede it. So exercising our freedom in the wrong ways is not true freedom, it is freedom devoid of the truth. </p>
        <p class="para_eleven">Respect for dignity and life is not limited to others but is extended to one’s self. Realizing that you matter, you are beautiful, handsome, and smart just the way you are is important. And not letting the “perfect” people we see on social media make us feel less than we are. This is a cause of body dysphoria which further leads to people thinking “Oh, I’m in the wrong body”.  Addressing the underlying cause is more important than administering temporary fixes.</p>
        <p class="para_twelve">Another cause of body dysphoria stems from bullies. It could be just that one “harmless” comment someone makes, it could be a snide remark, a negative comment about someone. We never really know what can set someone off or what can even further worsen the other person’s insecurity. So we should try as best as we can to be kind. Be kind to yourself, and be kind to everyone around you.
            Regardless of the choices people make, no matter how wrong and devoid of the truth their choices are, they are humans still and deserve dignity. So we should always respect the dignity, life, and freedom of people even when we don’t agree with their positions on certain issues.
